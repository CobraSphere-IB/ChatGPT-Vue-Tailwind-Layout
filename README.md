# ChatGPT-Vue-Tailwind-Layout

I asked:
> _Can you create a Tailwind CSS layout with horizontal and vertical collapsible navbars for use in the Vue framework?_

and I received:
> Yes, I can provide you with a sample layout for a horizontal and vertical collapsible navbar using Tailwind CSS in the Vue framework. 
> [see code]
> This layout uses Tailwind CSS to create a header with a horizontal navbar that is collapsible on smaller screens, and a vertical navbar on larger screens. The header and vertical navbar use a dark gray background color, and the links are styled in light teal. The main content area is separated from the header and side navbar with a container. The layout is responsive, with the vertical navbar hidden on smaller screens and the horizontal navbar becoming collapsible.

I asked:
> Can you push to GitHub?

and here was the answer!

> I'm sorry, I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to push code to GitHub. You can copy the code and paste it into a file on your own computer. Then, you can use Git to push the code to your GitHub repository. Here's a basic outline of the steps:

> 1. Copy the code and paste it into a file, such as `index.vue`.
> 2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
> 3. Initialize a Git repository by running `git init`.
> 4. Add the file to the repository by running `git add index.vue`.
> 5. Commit the changes by running `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
> 6. Push the code to your GitHub repository by running `git push origin master`, where `origin` is the name of your remote repository and `master` is the name of the branch you're pushing to.

Please note that you'll need to have a GitHub account and have created a repository before pushing code to it.

.. but I did everything through GitHub :)
